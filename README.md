## Front End Libraries Projects - Build a Pomodoro Clock

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/asteffey/fcc-pomodoro-clock.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/asteffey/fcc-pomodoro-clock)

The site is hosted at https://asteffey.github.io/fcc-pomodoro-clock.  
Alternatively, it can be viewed with the [freeCodeCamp test suite](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js) 
by appending [`?fcc-test`](https://asteffey.github.io/fcc-pomodoro-clock?fcc-test) to the URL.

This is a [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) project which uses React and Redux to create a Pomodoro clock. 
Additionally, this project also demonstrates the use of Material-UI, Jest, ESLint, and a basic CI/CD pipeline using Travis with deployment to GitHub pages.

The project requirements can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-pomodoro-clock.
